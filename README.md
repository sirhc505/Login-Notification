# Login Notification

## Purpose

If you consider the question "I want to be notified if anyone logs into my personal box.", then this script is for you. 

You can put this script in ```/etc/ssh/sshrc```. However, this method doesn't work if the user has their own ```~/.ssh/rc``` file.

So we will do this with pam_exec. The good thing is that this can also be easily adapted to login types other than ssh (such as local logins or even all logins) by hooking into a different file in ```/etc/pam.d/```

## Settings

### MY_HOSTNAME

This is the short version of the host name and not the FQDN.

### SMTP_SERVER

Specify the server and port for the server that will actually be transmitting the email. 

For example:

Simple port 25: smtp.mydomain.com

However for TLS

smtp.mydomain.com:587

If you are going to use TLS make sure the START_TLS is not commented out.

START_TLS="-S smtp-use-starttls"

### Message Source - Destination

I recommend that you use a fake email address for this purpose but make it identifiable so that you can understand the source easily.

```ini
SENDER="noreply-$MY_HOSTNAME@uconn.edu"
```

The recipient would be your cellphone in most cases.

```ini
RECIPIENT="555-555-1212@txt.att.net"
```

## Installation

Modify ```/etc/pam.d/sshd```

```text
session optional pam_exec.so seteuid /path/to/login-notify.sh
```
